#Data and scripts for Niche expansion of capuchin monkeys to forest floor on guild-reduced islands increases interspecific spatio-temporal overlap

#Raw data
-Supp.DATA_capuchin_terrestriality.csv
-Supp.DATA_CoibaBioblitz.csv
-Supp.DATA_tool_users.csv

#Processed data
-Processed_Data.csv

#Instructions
The raw data from Supp.DATA_tool_users.csv was coded using a 30 second temporal filter, rather than the 2-minute filter used in Supp.DATA_capuchin_terrestriality.csv and Supp.DATA_CoibaBioblitz.csv
Raw data from Supp.DATA_tool_users.csv must be recoded using a 2-minute filter, prior to running analyses. This is done on S1-Script-Data-Prep
Use S1-Script-Data-Prep for replicating data preparation and for the camera operation plots. 
For replicating the analyses directly use file "Processed_Data.csv" and start on S2-Script-Temporal Overlap
